        <h1>The Sermon on the Mount Goes Digital: Navigating Social Media with Grace</h1>
        <p>Beloved friends, as we gather upon this digital mount, let us ponder how the light of ancient wisdom can illuminate the shadowy valleys of your online worlds. For blessed are the peacemakers on social media, for they shall be called the children of God.</p>

        <p>"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God" (Matthew 5:8). In a realm where every post, like, and share is a reflection of your heart, strive for purity over popularity. Let your online presence be a mirror that reflects not the vanity of the world but the radiance of the spirit within.</p>

        <p>Consider the birds of the air: they neither tweet nor post yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? Therefore, do not worry about your next post or the number of your followers. Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you (Matthew 6:26, 33).</p>

        {/* Expanded Practical Advice Section */}
        <h2>Guidelines for Graceful Engagement</h2>
        <p>4. Salt of the Earth: "You are the salt of the earth" (Matthew 5:13). Your words and actions on social media should preserve and enhance the flavor of discourse, not lead to decay. Before posting, ask yourself if your contribution is savory or spoils the conversation. Be the seasoning that brings out the best, not the worst, in others.</p>
        
        <p>5. Light of the World: Just as a city set on a hill cannot be hidden, neither should your positive influence online (Matthew 5:14). Share stories of hope, acts of kindness, and words of encouragement. Illuminate the darker corners of the internet with your presence.</p>

        <p>6. Judge Not: "Do not judge, or you too will be judged" (Matthew 7:1). It's easy to pass judgment based on a single post or comment. Instead, strive for understanding and empathy. Remember, behind every profile is a person, a story, and a soul.</p>
        
        {/* Expanded Biblical Parallels for the Modern User */}
        <h2>Modern Parables for Social Media</h2>
        <p>Imagine the Widow's Mite story in today's context (Luke 21:1-4). In a world obsessed with crowdfunding and virality, it's often the smallest, most sincere contributions that hold the greatest value. Your small act of kindness online, like a supportive comment or sharing a friend's small business, can be worth more than the grandest viral post.</p>

        <p>Think of the parable of the sower (Matthew 13:1-23). As you sow your thoughts and content online, consider the type of ground they fall upon. Are you casting pearls before swine, or are you planting seeds in fertile soil, where they can grow and flourish?</p>

        {/* Additional Conclusion */}
        <h2>Embracing the Digital Beatitudes</h2>
        <p>As you venture forth, remember the beatitudes not just as lofty ideals, but as practical guides for your digital life. "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God" (Matthew 5:8). May your heart be pure in every tweet, post, and share, and in doing so, may you catch glimpses of the divine in the digital.</p>

        <p>Finally, "Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven" (Matthew 5:10). In standing up for what is right online, you might face opposition, but take heart, for your reward is great. For in the realm of the digital and beyond, the kingdom of heaven awaits.</p>

        <p>Go forth with grace, dear friends, and may your digital footprint be a pathway that leads others to the light. Amen.</p>
